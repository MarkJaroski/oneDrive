# One Drive gnome shell extension

This is a Gnome Shell extension I use as frontend for the unofficial abraunegg onedrive client (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive) on my desktop. 

# Features

One Drive Gnome Shell Extension can: 

- check that systemctl, onedrive and xdg-open are installed;
- start and stop oneddrive as user service;
- show the status of the abraunegg onedrive service;
- show an icon on the system tray (changing color if service is disabled, active o "in sync");
- show One Drive local folder;
- open One Drive web site.

# Missing

Lots of things... but I'm working on it!
